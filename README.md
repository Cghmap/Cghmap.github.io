## To Run the Website
Please make sure you have Python downloaded
- **Open the Terminal**: Begin by launching your terminal application. On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell. On macOS and Linux, you can use the Terminal application.
- **Navigate to the Website Folder**: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory that contains your website's source code. For example, if your website folder is on your desktop, you can use the following command:
`cd ~/Desktop/your-website-folder`
- **Start a Local Server**: Use the local server software of your choice to initiate a local server. If you are using Python 3, you can utilize the built-in HTTP server to create a basic server. In the terminal, navigate to your website's directory and run the following command:
`python3 -m http.server`
- **Access the Local Website**: In the terminal, you will receive a message indicating the port on which the server is listening (usually 8000 or 8080). Now, open your web browser and enter the following address in the browser's address bar:
`http://localhost:8000`
Alternatively, use the specific port number specified by the server. This will open your website in your local web browser
- **Stop the Local Server**: When you no longer need the local server, return to the terminal and press Ctrl + C to halt the server.
